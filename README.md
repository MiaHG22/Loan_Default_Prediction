# Loan_Default_Prediction
## Overview 

Lending is a vital tool that propels all enterprises and individuals worldwide to greater financial success. Many individuals utilize debt to buy a home or a vehicle. As the need for capital is rising, the loan defaults are also increasing. An organization wants to forcast who would default on their loans based on their demographic information. Various libraries and algorithms were used to build and evaluate the model using resampling including:
• imbalanced-learn
• scikit-learn
• SMOTE algorithm
• Random Forest Classifier

## Purpose

1. Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
2. Create training and test groups from a given data set.
3. Implement the Random Forest Classifier model.
4. Interpret the results 

## Conclusion
• The Random Forest approach is appropriate for classification and regression tasks on datasets with many entries and features that are likely to have missing values when we need a highly accurate result while avoiding overfitting.
